I am an incoming PHD student in Peking University， advised by [Shanghang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=voqw10cAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to this, I pursued my Master's degree, where I had the privilege of being advised by Prof. [Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/), [Jieyu Zhang](https://jieyuz2.github.io/), and  [Haonan wang](https://charles-haonan-wang.me/). Currently, I focuse on 3D vision and Embodied AI under the guidance of Prof. [Huazhe Xu](http://hxu.rocks/). 




**Research Interests**: My current research interests are **Data-centric AI , 3D vision, Embodied AI and Automatic Drive**. My academic goal is to advance the widespread adoption of AI and robotic technology in various aspects of human life. Additionally, I aim to conduct research aimed at developing more efficient and reliable AI technologies that contribute to the progress of humanity.
